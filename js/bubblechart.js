// Creating map for D3 lab

//Load window, then execute script
window.onload = function(){
    // Just like jQuery, d3 can select elements from the DOM and work with them
    var container = d3.select("body")
    // The above container variable holds the selection of the HTML body
    // The append method below is a type of D3 operator, indented to form a block
    // This chain has to use D3 methods as defined above
      .append("svg")
};
